# Overview

This example application provides a minimal setup for the Stytch React SDK with the pre-built UI components for both Login and Admin Portal (Member Management, Organization Settings, SSO and SCIM Configuration)

# Set up

Follow the steps below to get this application fully functional and running using your own Stytch credentials.

## In the Stytch Dashboard

1. Create a [Stytch](https://stytch.com/) account. Once your account is set up, a Project called "My first project" will be automatically created for you.
2. Within your new Project, navigate to [SDK configuration](https://stytch.com/dashboard/sdk-configuration), and click **Enable SDK**.
3. Navigate to [API Keys](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys). You will need the `project_id`, `secret`, and `public_token` values found on this page later on.

## On your machine

In your terminal clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stytchauth/stytch-b2b-react-quickstart-example.git
cd stytch-b2b-react-quickstart-example
# Install dependencies using npm
npm install
```

Next, create the `.env.local` file by running the command below which copies the contents of `.env.template`.

```bash
cp .env.template .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` in the text editor of your choice, and set the environment variables using the project_id, secret, and public_token found on [API Keys](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys).

## Running locally

After completing all the set up steps above the application can be run with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Flows to Explore
- [ ] Authenticate and create a new Organization
- [ ] Invite an alias of your email to the Organization in the "Members" tab
- [ ] Enable Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning for your work email domain in the "Settings" tab, and set an Automatic Role Assignment to have all users from that domain automatically be assigned the Admin Role
- [ ] In the [Roles & Permissions](https://stytch.com/dashboard/rbac) tab of the Stytch Dashboard, create a new `limited_admin` Role with the `update.info.name` and `update.info.slug` permissions for the `stytch.organization` Resource and log in as a Member with that Role. See how the Settings UI adjusts to account for their more limited permissions
- [ ] Set up Enterprise SSO in the "SSO" tab (if you don't have admin access to a workforce IdP, you can create an [Okta Workforce Identity Cloud Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) to test)
- [ ] Configure SCIM provisioning in the "SCIM" tab and provision users individually or by groups. Create an automatic role assignment for a specific IdP group in the "Settings" tab

# Next Steps

This example app showcases a small portion of what you can accomplish with Stytch. Next, explore adding additional login methods, such as [OAuth](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/oauth/initial-setup) or [SSO](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/sso/initial-setup).
